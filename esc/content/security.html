<h3 id="implicit-grant">Implicit Grant</h3>
<p>   Implicit grants improve the responsiveness and efficiency of some
   clients (such as a client implemented as an in-browser application),
   since it reduces the number of round trips required to obtain an
   access token. However, this convenience should be weighed against
   the security implications of using implicit grants, such as those
   described in Sections <a href="#Access-Tokens"><em>Access Tokens</em></a> and <a href="#misuse"><em>Misuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit Flow</em></a>, especially when the authorization code grant type is available.</p>
<h3 id="TLS-Version">TLS Version </h3>
<!-- Section 1.6.   -->
<p>   Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this
   specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of TLS will vary
   over time, based on the widespread deployment and known security
   vulnerabilities.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246" target="_blank">[RFC5246]</a> is the most recent version, but has a very limited deployment base and might not be readily available for
   implementation. TLS version 1.0 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2246" target="_blank">[RFC2246]</a> is the most widely deployed version and will provide the broadest interoperability.</p>
<p>   Implementations MAY also support additional transport-layer security
   mechanisms that meet the requirements of this protocol, as defined in <a href="message-encoding-and-transport.html#transport">Message Encoding and Transport</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability</h3>
<!-- Section 1.8. -->  
<p>   OAuth 2.0 provides a rich authorization framework with well-defined
   security properties.  However, as a rich and highly extensible
   framework with many optional components, on its own, this
   specification is likely to produce a wide range of non-interoperable
   implementations.</p>
<p>   In addition, this specification leaves a few required components
   partially or fully undefined (e.g., client registration,
   <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a> capabilities, endpoint discovery).  Without these components, clients must be manually and specifically
   configured against a specific <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a> and resource
   server in order to interoperate.</p>
<p>   This framework was designed with the clear expectation that future
   work will define prescriptive profiles and extensions necessary to
   achieve full web-scale interoperability.</p>
<h3 id="Access-Tokens">Access Tokens </h3>
<!-- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.3 -->
<p> Access token credentials (as well as any confidential access token
   attributes) MUST be kept confidential in transit and storage, and
   only shared among the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a>, the resource servers the
   access token is valid for, and the client to whom the access token is
   issued.  Access token credentials MUST only be transmitted using TLS
   as described in Section <a href="#TLS-Version"><em>&quot;TLS Version&quot;</em></a> above with server authentication as defined by
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818" target="_blank">[RFC2818]</a>.</p>
<p>   When using the implicit grant type, the access token is transmitted
   in the URI fragment, which can expose it to unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>   The <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a> MUST ensure that access tokens cannot be
   generated, modified, or guessed to produce valid access tokens by
   unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>   The client SHOULD request access tokens with the minimal scope
   necessary.  The <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

<p>   This specification does not provide any methods for the resource

<h3 id="cross-site">Cross-Site Request Forgery </h3>
<!-- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12 -->
<p> Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an exploit in which an attacker
   causes the user-agent of a victim end-user to follow a malicious URI
   (e.g., provided to the user-agent as a misleading link, image, or
   redirection) to a trusting server (usually established via the
   presence of a valid session cookie).</p>
<p>   A CSRF attack against the client&apos;s redirection URI allows an attacker
   to inject its own authorization code or access token, which can
   result in the client using an access token associated with the
   attacker&apos;s protected resources rather than the victim&apos;s (e.g., save
   the victim&apos;s bank account information to a protected resource
   controlled by the attacker).</p>
<p>   The client MUST implement CSRF <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#protection" class="glossary-term" title="To avoid harmful interference from lower-tier user(s) to the upper tier user(s).">protection</a> for its redirection URI.
   This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the
   redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to
   the user-agent&apos;s authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session
   cookie used to authenticate the user-agent).  The client SHOULD
   utilize the &quot;state&quot; request parameter to deliver this value to the
   <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a> when making an authorization request.</p>
<p>   Once authorization has been obtained from the end-user, the
   <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a> redirects the end-user&apos;s user-agent back to the
   client with the required binding value contained in the &quot;state&quot;
   parameter.  The binding value enables the client to verify the
   validity of the request by matching the binding value to the
   user-agent&apos;s authenticated state.  The binding value used for CSRF
   <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#protection" class="glossary-term" title="To avoid harmful interference from lower-tier user(s) to the upper tier user(s).">protection</a> MUST contain a non-guessable value (as described in
   <a href="#Credentials-Guessing-Attacks">Credentials-Guessing Attacks</a>), and the user-agent&apos;s authenticated state (e.g.,
   session cookie, HTML5 local storage) MUST be kept in a location
   accessible only to the client and the user-agent (i.e., protected by
   same-origin policy).</p>
<p>   A CSRF attack against the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a>&apos;s authorization
   endpoint can result in an attacker obtaining end-user authorization
   for a malicious client without involving or alerting the end-user.</p>

   authorization endpoint and ensure that a malicious client cannot
   obtain authorization without the awareness and explicit consent of
   the resource owner.</p>
<h3 id="misuse">Misuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit Flow </h3>
<!-- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.16 -->
<p>   For public clients using implicit flows, this specification does not
   provide any method for the client to determine what client an access
   token was issued to.</p>
<p>   A resource owner may willingly delegate access to a resource by
   granting an access token to an attacker&apos;s malicious client.  This may
   be due to phishing or some other pretext.  An attacker may also steal
   a token via some other mechanism.  An attacker may then attempt to
   impersonate the resource owner by providing the access token to a
   legitimate public client.</p>
<p>   In the implicit flow (response_type=token), the attacker can easily
   switch the token in the response from the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#authorization-server" class="glossary-term" title="The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.">authorization server</a>,
   replacing the real access token with the one previously issued to the
   attacker.</p>
<p>   Servers communicating with native applications that rely on being
   passed an access token in the back channel to identify the user of
   the client may be similarly compromised by an attacker creating a
   compromised application that can inject arbitrary stolen access
   tokens.</p>
<p>   Any public client that makes the assumption that only the resource
   owner can present it with a valid access token for the resource is
   vulnerable to this type of attack.</p>
<p>   This type of attack may expose information about the resource owner
   at the legitimate client to the attacker (malicious client).  This
   will also allow the attacker to perform operations at the legitimate
   client with the same permissions as the resource owner who originally
   granted the access token or authorization code.</p>
<p>   Authenticating resource owners to clients is out of scope for this
   specification.  Any specification that uses the authorization process
   as a form of delegated end-user authentication to the client (e.g.,
   third-party sign-in service) MUST NOT use the implicit flow without
   additional security mechanisms that would enable the client to
   determine if the access token was issued for its use (e.g., audience-
   restricting the access token).</p>
