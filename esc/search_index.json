The SAS registers with the ESC and begins the normal mode of operation:\nHeartbeat polling to ensure connection and system liveness\nAccepting and processing event notifications from the ESC\nUpdating the ESC with the most recent information about the SAS, should it change\n\n\nEnd of Service. Here the SAS ceases co-operating with the ESC by sending a de-registration message. The ESC Operator may remove the SAS's PKI information.

Key Bridge further expects that each ESC, or at least the ESC in this proposal, will be independent and autonomous to the one or more SASs that depend upon their respective ESC for incumbent detection. The same principle applies in reverse as well: a SAS's internal architecture and configuration is also independent and autonomous to its ESC, and each ESC may pursue different strategies and implement different technologies for incumbent detection.\nRegardless of their respective internal architecture, technology and detection strategies, a ESC and SAS must interface to share information about spectrum availability or un-availability. This essential concept is called peering and is shown in the illustration below. Through peering a SAS and ESC may exchange data in a neutral manner irrespective of their internal architecture and configuration.\n  \n"},"content/introduction/peering-protocol-independence.html":{"url":"content/introduction/peering-protocol-independence.html","title":"SAS-ESC Peering Protocol","keywords":"","body":"SAS-ESC Peering Protocol\nA SAS exterior peering protocol standard will place no constraint on the internal architecture and operation of the various entities that use the protocol. Referring again to Illustration 1, a generic peering process enables SAS of unknown constitution on the left peers with a Key Bridge ESC on the right.\n\nThis paragraph needs to be reviewed\nSAS to ESC peering operational security policies and configurations are under development within a multi-stakeholder group in which Key Bridge is a participant (The Wireless Innovation Forum, Spectrum Sharing Committee, Working Group 2: Security). The actual protocol and data structures for SAS to ESC peering is not the subject of multi-stakeholder group consideration. Key Bridge has therefore invented proprietary and also proposed non-proprietary methods that a SAS may use when coordinating with a ESC to dynamically protect a non-informing incumbent spectrum user. The Key Bridge SAS Gateway Protocol is, at present, a proprietary application peering protocol that includes mechanisms to support cryptographically secure message exchange for both SAS to SAS and SAS to ESC peering, including all security prescriptions identified by the multi-stakeholder group.\n\nA SAS and ESC Peering relationship using the SAS Gateway Protocol is secure and neutral. A SAS Infrastructure may register with and receive information from any inter-operable ESC Infrastructure supporting a peering service. When using the Key Bridge SAS Gateway Protocol a compatible SAS may register with and receive information from a compatible ESC via a designated ESC Peering API.\nIn the Key Bridge architecture ESC Service Nodes are responsible for Non-Informing Incumbent User (NIIU) detection services and peer directly with a subscribing SAS via the SAS Gateway Protocol. This strategy is designed to limit the geographic extent of NIIU information conveyed to a SAS to that necessary for the SAS to administer CBSDs in a specific geographic region. However, the ESC places no constraint on SAS internal architecture or operation, and a SAS may peer with multiple ESC Service Nodes.\n"},"content/introduction/generic-workflow.html":{"url":"content/introduction/generic-workflow.html","title":"Generic SAS Peering Workflow","keywords":"","body":"Generic SAS Peering Workflow\n\nIllustration 2: ESC Service Nodes provide Non-Informing Incumbent User (NIIU) detection services to a SAS\nThe process of a generic SAS peering with the Key Bridge ESC Infrastructure is detailed in Illustration 2, and proceeds according to the following general strategy.\n\nRequest. A SAS first inquires about service availability to the ESC Infrastructure via a general peering API interface. The SAS service request includes the geographic area or areas where the SAS wishes to provide spectrum administration. If ESC services are not available in the requested geographic area the request is rejected (i.e. fails), otherwise the request is assigned to a matching ESC Service Node.\n\nAssignment. If NIIU detection capability is available in the SAS requested geographic area the ESC Infrastructure will assign the SAS registration request to a matching ESC Service Node.\n\nRegister. After a geographic match has been established the respective ESC Service Node and the SAS exchange detailed information necessary to establish a direct and persistent peering relationship. The registration process includes conveying to the ESC Peer the specific SAS geographic regions of responsibility plus instructions describing how the ESC may query the SAS for additional information and also how to notify the SAS of ESC spectrum availability information, updates and instructions.\n\nPeer. Once established the ESC Service Node will respond to spectrum availability requests within its geographic area of service and also inform the SAS about any changes in spectrum availability.\n\n\nAn artifact of this CONOPS is that the Key Bridge ESC Service Nodes are assigned responsibility to determine the quantity and quality of protection for the incumbent user within their ESC Service Area, while responsibility to effect that protection is retained within a SAS. That is to say: An ESC Service Node is the service providing component of the ESC Infrastructure, and it is the ESC Service Node that authorizes or de-authorizes CBSD operations within their responsible service area according to a geographic partitioning strategy within their respective ESC Service Area.\n"},"content/authorization/":{"url":"content/authorization/","title":"Concept of Operations","keywords":"","body":"Authentication and Authorization CONOPs\nFigure 1 - Authentication and Authorization Concept of Operations\nAuthentication involves Key Exchange between the SAS operator and the ESC operator.\nAuthorization involves a two-legged OAuth.\n"},"content/authorization/authentication.html":{"url":"content/authorization/authentication.html","title":"SAS Authentication","keywords":"","body":"SAS Client Authentication\nFigure 2 - SAS-ESC Authentication\nPrior to SAS-ESC communications, the (human) ESC operator and SAS administrators must exchange the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

However, this convenience should be weighed against\n   the security implications of using implicit grants, such as those\n   described in Sections Access Tokens and Misuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit Flow, especially when the authorization code grant type is available.\nTLS Version \n\n   Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this\n   specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of TLS will vary\n   over time, based on the widespread deployment and known security\n   vulnerabilities.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2\n   [RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has a very limited deployment base and might not be readily available for\n   implementation. TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely deployed version and will provide the broadest interoperability.\n   Implementations MAY also support additional transport-layer security\n   mechanisms that meet the requirements of this protocol, as defined in Message Encoding and Transport.\nInteroperability\n  \n   OAuth 2.0 provides a rich authorization framework with well-defined\n   security properties.  However, as a rich and highly extensible\n   framework with many optional components, on its own, this\n   specification is likely to produce a wide range of non-interoperable\n   implementations.\n   In addition, this specification leaves a few required components\n   partially or fully undefined (e.g., client registration,\n   authorization server capabilities, endpoint discovery).  Without these components, clients must be manually and specifically\n   configured against a specific authorization server and resource\n   server in order to interoperate.\n   This framework was designed with the clear expectation that future\n   work will define prescriptive profiles and extensions necessary to\n   achieve full web-scale interoperability.\nAccess Tokens \n\n Access token credentials (as well as any confidential access token\n   attributes) MUST be kept confidential in transit and storage, and\n   only shared among the authorization server, the resource servers the\n   access token is valid for, and the client to whom the access token is\n   issued.  Access token credentials MUST only be transmitted using TLS\n   as described in Section \"TLS Version\" above with server authentication as defined by\n   [RFC2818].\n   When using the implicit grant type, the access token is transmitted\n   in the URI fragment, which can expose it to unauthorized parties.\n   The authorization server MUST ensure that access tokens cannot be\n   generated, modified, or guessed to produce valid access tokens by\n   unauthorized parties.\n   The client SHOULD request access tokens with the minimal scope\n   necessary.  The authorization server SHOULD take the client identity\n   into account when choosing how to honor the requested scope and MAY\n   issue an access token with less rights than requested.\n   This specification does not provide any methods for the resource\n   server to ensure that an access token presented to it by a given\n   client was issued to that client by the authorization server.\nCredentials-Guessing Attacks\n\n   The authorization server MUST prevent attackers from guessing access\n   tokens, authorization codes, refresh tokens, resource owner\n   passwords, and client credentials.\n   The probability of an attacker guessing generated tokens (and other\n   credentials not intended for handling by end-users) MUST be less than\n   or equal to 2^(-128) and SHOULD be less than or equal to 2^(-160).\n   The authorization server MUST utilize other means to protect\n   credentials intended for end-user usage.\nCross-Site Request Forgery \n\n Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an exploit in which an attacker\n   causes the user-agent of a victim end-user to follow a malicious URI\n   (e.g., provided to the user-agent as a misleading link, image, or\n   redirection) to a trusting server (usually established via the\n   presence of a valid session cookie).\n   A CSRF attack against the client's redirection URI allows an attacker\n   to inject its own authorization code or access token, which can\n   result in the client using an access token associated with the\n   attacker's protected resources rather than the victim's (e.g., save\n   the victim's bank account information to a protected resource\n   controlled by the attacker).\n   The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI.\n   This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the\n   redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to\n   the user-agent's authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session\n   cookie used to authenticate the user-agent).  The client SHOULD\n   utilize the \"state\" request parameter to deliver this value to the\n   authorization server when making an authorization request.\n   Once authorization has been obtained from the end-user, the\n   authorization server redirects the end-user's user-agent back to the\n   client with the required binding value contained in the \"state\"\n   parameter.  The binding value enables the client to verify the\n   validity of the request by matching the binding value to the\n   user-agent's authenticated state.  The binding value used for CSRF\n   protection MUST contain a non-guessable value (as described in\n   Credentials-Guessing Attacks), and the user-agent's authenticated state (e.g.,\n   session cookie, HTML5 local storage) MUST be kept in a location\n   accessible only to the client and the user-agent (i.e., protected by\n   same-origin policy).\n   A CSRF attack against the authorization server's authorization\n   endpoint can result in an attacker obtaining end-user authorization\n   for a malicious client without involving or alerting the end-user.\n   The authorization server MUST implement CSRF protection for its\n   authorization endpoint and ensure that a malicious client cannot\n   obtain authorization without the awareness and explicit consent of\n   the resource owner.\nMisuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit Flow \n\n   For public clients using implicit flows, this specification does not\n   provide any method for the client to determine what client an access\n   token was issued to.\n   A resource owner may willingly delegate access to a resource by\n   granting an access token to an attacker's malicious client.  This may\n   be due to phishing or some other pretext.  An attacker may also steal\n   a token via some other mechanism.  An attacker may then attempt to\n   impersonate the resource owner by providing the access token to a\n   legitimate public client.\n   In the implicit flow (response_type=token), the attacker can easily\n   switch the token in the response from the authorization server,\n   replacing the real access token with the one previously issued to the\n   attacker.\n   Servers communicating with native applications that rely on being\n   passed an access token in the back channel to identify the user of\n   the client may be similarly compromised by an attacker creating a\n   compromised application that can inject arbitrary stolen access\n   tokens.\n   Any public client that makes the assumption that only the resource\n   owner can present it with a valid access token for the resource is\n   vulnerable to this type of attack.\n   This type of attack may expose information about the resource owner\n   at the legitimate client to the attacker (malicious client).  This\n   will also allow the attacker to perform operations at the legitimate\n   client with the same permissions as the resource owner who originally\n   granted the access token or authorization code.\n   Authenticating resource owners to clients is out of scope for this\n   specification.  Any specification that uses the authorization process\n   as a form of delegated end-user authentication to the client (e.g.,\n   third-party sign-in service) MUST NOT use the implicit flow without\n   additional security mechanisms that would enable the client to\n   determine if the access token was issued for its use (e.g., audience-\n   restricting the access token).\n"},"content/urlencoded.html":{"url":"content/urlencoded.html","title":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded Media Type","keywords":"","body":"Use of application/x-www-form-urlencoded Media Type\nExcerpted from Appendix B of OAuth 2.0 RFC at\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#appendix-B\n\n  At the time of publication of OAuth 2.0 specification, the\n   \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" media type was defined in\n   Section 17.13.4 of W3C.REC-html401-19991224 but not registered in\n   the IANA MIME Media Types registry\n   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types).
