In this stage human SAS Administrator and ESC Operator exchange the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This ensures full knowledge of identities of systems that are communicating. \nNormal Operation. The SAS registers with the ESC and begins the normal mode of operation:\nHeartbeat polling to ensure connection and system liveness\nAccepting and processing event notifications from the ESC\nUpdating the ESC with the most recent information about the SAS, should it change\n\n\nEnd of Service. Here the SAS ceases co-operating with the ESC by sending a de-registration message. The ESC Operator may remove the SAS's PKI information. This step may never occur \n\n \nFigure 1: High-Level Communication Lifecycle from a SAS Perspective\nData flows in the Communication Lifecycle\n \nFigure 3: SAS-ESC Communication Lifecycle\n"},"content/introduction/independence.html":{"url":"content/introduction/independence.html","title":"SAS-ESC Independence","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 0;\n}\n\nSAS-ESC Independence\nKey Bridge expects the FCC to authorize more than one party to operate a ESC, and that the internal architecture and configuration of each ESC may differ. Key Bridge further expects that each ESC, or at least the ESC in this proposal, will be independent and autonomous to the one or more SASs that depend upon their respective ESC for incumbent detection. The same principle applies in reverse as well: a SAS's internal architecture and configuration is also independent and autonomous to its ESC, and each ESC may pursue different strategies and implement different technologies for incumbent detection.\nRegardless of their respective internal architecture, technology and detection strategies, a ESC and SAS must interface to share information about spectrum availability or un-availability. This essential concept is called peering and is shown in the illustration below. Through peering a SAS and ESC may exchange data in a neutral manner irrespective of their internal architecture and configuration.\nIllustration 1: SAS to ESC Peering masks internal architecture\n"},"content/introduction/peering-protocol-independence.html":{"url":"content/introduction/peering-protocol-independence.html","title":"SAS-ESC Peering Protocol","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 1;\n}\n\n\nSAS-ESC Peering Protocol\nA SAS exterior peering protocol standard will place no constraint on the internal architecture and operation of the various entities that use the protocol. Referring again to Illustration 1, a generic peering process enables SAS of unknown constitution on the left peers with a Key Bridge ESC on the right.\n\nThis paragraph needs to be reviewed\nSAS to ESC peering operational security policies and configurations are under development within a multi-stakeholder group in which Key Bridge is a participant (The Wireless Innovation Forum, Spectrum Sharing Committee, Working Group 2: Security). The actual protocol and data structures for SAS to ESC peering is not the subject of multi-stakeholder group consideration. Key Bridge has therefore invented proprietary and also proposed non-proprietary methods that a SAS may use when coordinating with a ESC to dynamically protect a non-informing incumbent spectrum user. The Key Bridge SAS Gateway Protocol is, at present, a proprietary application peering protocol that includes mechanisms to support cryptographically secure message exchange for both SAS to SAS and SAS to ESC peering, including all security prescriptions identified by the multi-stakeholder group.\n\nA SAS and ESC Peering relationship using the SAS Gateway Protocol is secure and neutral. A SAS Infrastructure may register with and receive information from any inter-operable ESC Infrastructure supporting a peering service. When using the Key Bridge SAS Gateway Protocol a compatible SAS may register with and receive information from a compatible ESC via a designated ESC Peering API.\nIn the Key Bridge architecture ESC Service Nodes are responsible for Non-Informing Incumbent User (NIIU) detection services and peer directly with a subscribing SAS via the SAS Gateway Protocol. This strategy is designed to limit the geographic extent of NIIU information conveyed to a SAS to that necessary for the SAS to administer CBSDs in a specific geographic region. However, the ESC places no constraint on SAS internal architecture or operation, and a SAS may peer with multiple ESC Service Nodes.\n"},"content/introduction/generic-workflow.html":{"url":"content/introduction/generic-workflow.html","title":"Generic SAS Peering Workflow","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 2;\n}\n\nGeneric SAS Peering Workflow\n\nIllustration 2: ESC Service Nodes provide Non-Informing Incumbent User (NIIU) detection services to a SAS\nThe process of a generic SAS peering with the Key Bridge ESC Infrastructure is detailed in Illustration 2, and proceeds according to the following general strategy.\n\nRequest. A SAS first inquires about service availability to the ESC Infrastructure via a general peering API interface. The SAS service request includes the geographic area or areas where the SAS wishes to provide spectrum administration. If ESC services are not available in the requested geographic area the request is rejected (i.e. fails), otherwise the request is assigned to a matching ESC Service Node.\n\nAssignment. If NIIU detection capability is available in the SAS requested geographic area the ESC Infrastructure will assign the SAS registration request to a matching ESC Service Node.\n\nRegister. After a geographic match has been established the respective ESC Service Node and the SAS exchange detailed information necessary to establish a direct and persistent peering relationship. The registration process includes conveying to the ESC Peer the specific SAS geographic regions of responsibility plus instructions describing how the ESC may query the SAS for additional information and also how to notify the SAS of ESC spectrum availability information, updates and instructions.\n\nPeer. Once established the ESC Service Node will respond to spectrum availability requests within its geographic area of service and also inform the SAS about any changes in spectrum availability.\n\n\nAn artifact of this CONOPS is that the Key Bridge ESC Service Nodes are assigned responsibility to determine the quantity and quality of protection for the incumbent user within their ESC Service Area, while responsibility to effect that protection is retained within a SAS. That is to say: An ESC Service Node is the service providing component of the ESC Infrastructure, and it is the ESC Service Node that authorizes or de-authorizes CBSD operations within their responsible service area according to a geographic partitioning strategy within their respective ESC Service Area.\n"},"content/authorization/authorization-registration.html":{"url":"content/authorization/authorization-registration.html","title":"SAS Registration (Authentication)","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 3;\n}\n\nSAS Client Authentication\nPrior to SAS-ESC communications, the (human) ESC operator and SAS administrators must exchange the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In particular, at the end of this step, the ESC must posses the SAS's public key and the SAS must posses the public key of the ESC. \n If the client type is confidential, the client and authorization server establish a client authentication method suitable for the security requirements of the authorization server.  The authorization server MAY accept any form of client authentication meeting its security requirements.\nConfidential clients are typically issued (or establish) a set of client credentials used for authenticating with the authorization server (e.g., password, public/private key pair). \nThe client MUST NOT use more than one authentication method in each request.\n"},"content/authorization/authorization.html":{"url":"content/authorization/authorization.html","title":"Authorization Overview","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 4;\n}\n\nAuthorization\n\nAuthorization is based on OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow as described in RFC 6749 \"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework\". \nOAuth 2.0 enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.\nIn OAuth, the client requests access to resources controlled by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is issued a different set of credentials than those of the resource owner. Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources, the client obtains an access token -- a string denoting a specific scope, lifetime, and other access attributes.  Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the approval of the resource owner.  The client uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.\nFor example, an end-user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to her protected photos stored at a photo- sharing service (resource server), without sharing her username and password with the printing service.  Instead, she authenticates directly with a server trusted by the photo-sharing service (authorization server), which issues the printing service delegation- specific credentials (access token).\nTo request an access token, the client obtains authorization from the resource owner.  The authorization is expressed in the form of an authorization grant, which the client uses to request the access token.  \nOAuth defines four grant types: \n\nauthorization code\nimplicit \nresource owner password credentials, and \nclient credentials.  \n\nIt also provides an extension mechanism for defining additional grant types.\nIn this application, implicit grant is used.\n"},"content/authorization/authorization-roles.html":{"url":"content/authorization/authorization-roles.html","title":"Roles","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 5;\n}\n\nRoles\nOAuth defines four roles:\n1.

Resource Server (ESC Server):\n\nThe server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.\n\n3. Client (SAS):\n\nAn application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.  The term \"client\" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).\n\n4. Authorization Server:\n\nThe server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.\nThe authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.\n\nAdditionally, in the context of Implicit flow, user agent is also involved:\n5.

In the implicit flow, instead of issuing the client\n   an authorization code, the client is issued an access token directly (as the result of the resource owner authorization).  The grant type\n   is implicit, as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization\n   code) are issued (and later used to obtain an access token).\n   When issuing an access token during the implicit grant flow, the\n   authorization server does not authenticate the client.

These clients are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript.\n Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the authorization server.\n Unlike the authorization code grant type, in which the client makes separate requests for authorization and for an access token, the client receives the access token as the result of the authorization request.\n The implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and relies on the presence of the resource owner and the registration of the redirection URI.  Because the access token is encoded into the redirection URI, it may be exposed to the resource owner and other applications residing on the same device.\nFigure 4: Implicit Grant Flow\nNote: The lines illustrating steps (A) and (B) are broken into two\nparts as they pass through the user-agent.\nBased on RFC 6749, the flow illustrated in Figure 4 includes the following steps:\n   (A)  The SAS client initiates the flow by directing the ESC Operator's\n        user-agent to the authorization endpoint.  The SAS includes\n        its SAS client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a\n        redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the\n        user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).\n   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the ESC Operator (via\n        the user-agent) and establishes whether the ESC Operator\n        grants or denies the client's access request.\n   (C)  Assuming the ESC Operator grants access, the authorization\n        server redirects the user-agent back to the SAS client using the\n        redirection URI provided earlier.  The redirection URI includes\n        the access token in the URI fragment.\n   (D)  The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making a\n        request to the web-hosted client resource (which does not\n        include the fragment per [RFC2616]).  The user-agent retains the\n        fragment information locally.\n   (E)  The web-hosted client resource returns a web page (typically an\n        HTML document with an embedded script) capable of accessing the\n        full redirection URI including the fragment retained by the\n        user-agent, and extracting the access token (and other\n        parameters) contained in the fragment.\n   (F)  The user-agent executes the script provided by the web-hosted\n        client resource locally, which extracts the access token.\n   (G)  The user-agent passes the access token to the SAS client.\n"},"content/authorization/authorization-implicit-request.html":{"url":"content/authorization/authorization-implicit-request.html","title":"Request","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 9;\n}\n\nImplicit Flow - Authorization Request\n\nThe client constructs the request URI by adding the following\nparameters to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI\nusing the \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" format:\n\n\n\nFIELD NAME\nR/O/C\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\nresponse_type\nREQUIRED\nValue MUST be set to \"token\".\n\n\nclient_id\nREQUIRED\nThe client identifier\n\n\nredirect_uri\nOPTIONAL\nAs described in Section Redirection Endpoint\n\n\nscope\nOPTIONAL\nThe scope of the access request as described by Section Access Token Scope\n\n\nstate\nRECOMMENDED\nAn opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and callback.

The access token string size is left undefined by this specification. The client should avoid making assumptions about value sizes. The authorization server SHOULD document the size of any value it issues.\nAccess Token Types\n\nThe access token type provides the client with the information\n   required to successfully utilize the access token to make a protected\n   resource request (along with type-specific attributes).  The client\n   MUST NOT use an access token if it does not understand the token\n   type.\n   For example, the \"bearer\" token type defined in [RFC6750] is utilized\n   by simply including the access token string in the request:\n     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1\n     Host: example.com\n     Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM\n   while the \"mac\" token type defined in [OAuth-HTTP-MAC] is utilized by\n   issuing a Message Authentication Code (MAC) key together with the\n   access token that is used to sign certain components of the HTTP\n   requests:\n     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1\n     Host: example.com\n     Authorization: MAC id=\"h480djs93hd8\",\n                        nonce=\"274312:dj83hs9s\",\n                        mac=\"kDZvddkndxvhGRXZhvuDjEWhGeE=\"\n   The above examples are provided for illustration purposes only.\n   Developers are advised to consult the [RFC6750] and [OAuth-HTTP-MAC]\n   specifications before use.\n   Each access token type definition specifies the additional attributes\n   (if any) sent to the client together with the \"access_token\" response\n   parameter.

This specification does\n   not mandate the use of TLS because at the time of this writing,\n   requiring clients to deploy TLS is a significant hurdle for many\n   client developers.  If TLS is not available, the authorization server\n   SHOULD warn the resource owner about the insecure endpoint prior to\n   redirection (e.g., display a message during the authorization\n   request).\n   Lack of transport-layer security can have a severe impact on the\n   security of the client and the protected resources it is authorized\n   to access.  The use of transport-layer security is particularly\n   critical when the authorization process is used as a form of\n   delegated end-user authentication by the client (e.g., third-party\n   sign-in service).\nRegistration Requirements\n   The authorization server MUST require the following clients to\n   register their redirection endpoint:\n\nPublic clients.\n\nConfidential clients utilizing the implicit grant type.\nThe authorization server SHOULD require all clients to register their\nredirection endpoint prior to utilizing the authorization endpoint.\nThe authorization server SHOULD require the client to provide the\ncomplete redirection URI (the client MAY use the \"state\" request\nparameter to achieve per-request customization).  If requiring the\nregistration of the complete redirection URI is not possible, the\nauthorization server SHOULD require the registration of the URI\nscheme, authority, and path (allowing the client to dynamically vary\nonly the query component of the redirection URI when requesting\nauthorization).\nThe authorization server MAY allow the client to register multiple\nredirection endpoints.\nLack of a redirection URI registration requirement can enable an\nattacker to use the authorization endpoint as an open redirector. \n\n\n\nOpen Redirectors (Security Consideration)\n   The authorization server, authorization endpoint, and client\n   redirection endpoint can be improperly configured and operate as open\n   redirectors.  An open redirector is an endpoint using a parameter to\n   automatically redirect a user-agent to the location specified by the\n   parameter value without any validation.\n   Open redirectors can be used in phishing attacks, or by an attacker\n   to get end-users to visit malicious sites by using the URI authority\n   component of a familiar and trusted destination.  In addition, if the\n   authorization server allows the client to register only part of the\n   redirection URI, an attacker can use an open redirector operated by the client to construct a redirection URI that will pass the\n   authorization server validation but will send the authorization code\n   or access token to an endpoint under the control of the attacker.\nDynamic Configuration\n   If multiple redirection URIs have been registered, if only part of\n   the redirection URI has been registered, or if no redirection URI has\n   been registered, the client MUST include a redirection URI with the\n   authorization request using the \"redirect_uri\" request parameter.\n   When a redirection URI is included in an authorization request, the\n   authorization server MUST compare and match the value received\n   against at least one of the registered redirection URIs (or URI\n   components) as defined in [RFC3986] Section 6, if any redirection\n   URIs were registered.  If the client registration included the full\n   redirection URI, the authorization server MUST compare the two URIs\n   using simple string comparison as defined in [RFC3986] Section 6.2.1.\nInvalid Endpoint\n   If an authorization request fails validation due to a missing,\n   invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, the authorization server\n   SHOULD inform the resource owner of the error and MUST NOT\n   automatically redirect the user-agent to the invalid redirection URI.\nEndpoint Content\n   The redirection request to the client's endpoint typically results in\n   an HTML document response, processed by the user-agent.  If the HTML\n   response is served directly as the result of the redirection request,\n   any script included in the HTML document will execute with full\n   access to the redirection URI and the credentials it contains.\n   The client SHOULD NOT include any third-party scripts (e.g., third-\n   party analytics, social plug-ins, ad networks) in the redirection\n   endpoint response.  Instead, it SHOULD extract the credentials from\n   the URI and redirect the user-agent again to another endpoint without\n   exposing the credentials (in the URI or elsewhere).  If third-party\n   scripts are included, the client MUST ensure that its own scripts\n   (used to extract and remove the credentials from the URI) will\n   execute first.\n"},"content/endpoints/04-scope.html":{"url":"content/endpoints/04-scope.html","title":"Access Token Scope","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 16;\n}\n\nAccess Token Scope\n   The authorization and token endpoints allow the client to specify the\n   scope of the access request using the \"scope\" request parameter.

However, this convenience should be weighed against\n   the security implications of using implicit grants, such as those\n   described in Sections Access Tokens and Misuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit Flow, especially when the authorization code grant type is available.\nTLS Version \n\n   Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this\n   specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of TLS will vary\n   over time, based on the widespread deployment and known security\n   vulnerabilities.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2\n   [RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has a very limited deployment base and might not be readily available for\n   implementation. TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely deployed version and will provide the broadest interoperability.\n   Implementations MAY also support additional transport-layer security\n   mechanisms that meet the requirements of this protocol, as defined in Message Encoding and Transport.\nInteroperability\n  \n   OAuth 2.0 provides a rich authorization framework with well-defined\n   security properties.  However, as a rich and highly extensible\n   framework with many optional components, on its own, this\n   specification is likely to produce a wide range of non-interoperable\n   implementations.\n   In addition, this specification leaves a few required components\n   partially or fully undefined (e.g., client registration,\n   authorization server capabilities, endpoint discovery).  Without these components, clients must be manually and specifically\n   configured against a specific authorization server and resource\n   server in order to interoperate.\n   This framework was designed with the clear expectation that future\n   work will define prescriptive profiles and extensions necessary to\n   achieve full web-scale interoperability.\nAccess Tokens \n\n Access token credentials (as well as any confidential access token\n   attributes) MUST be kept confidential in transit and storage, and\n   only shared among the authorization server, the resource servers the\n   access token is valid for, and the client to whom the access token is\n   issued.  Access token credentials MUST only be transmitted using TLS\n   as described in Section \"TLS Version\" above with server authentication as defined by\n   [RFC2818].\n   When using the implicit grant type, the access token is transmitted\n   in the URI fragment, which can expose it to unauthorized parties.\n   The authorization server MUST ensure that access tokens cannot be\n   generated, modified, or guessed to produce valid access tokens by\n   unauthorized parties.\n   The client SHOULD request access tokens with the minimal scope\n   necessary.  The authorization server SHOULD take the client identity\n   into account when choosing how to honor the requested scope and MAY\n   issue an access token with less rights than requested.\n   This specification does not provide any methods for the resource\n   server to ensure that an access token presented to it by a given\n   client was issued to that client by the authorization server.\nCredentials-Guessing Attacks\n\n   The authorization server MUST prevent attackers from guessing access\n   tokens, authorization codes, refresh tokens, resource owner\n   passwords, and client credentials.\n   The probability of an attacker guessing generated tokens (and other\n   credentials not intended for handling by end-users) MUST be less than\n   or equal to 2^(-128) and SHOULD be less than or equal to 2^(-160).\n   The authorization server MUST utilize other means to protect\n   credentials intended for end-user usage.\nCross-Site Request Forgery \n\n Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an exploit in which an attacker\n   causes the user-agent of a victim end-user to follow a malicious URI\n   (e.g., provided to the user-agent as a misleading link, image, or\n   redirection) to a trusting server (usually established via the\n   presence of a valid session cookie).\n   A CSRF attack against the client's redirection URI allows an attacker\n   to inject its own authorization code or access token, which can\n   result in the client using an access token associated with the\n   attacker's protected resources rather than the victim's (e.g., save\n   the victim's bank account information to a protected resource\n   controlled by the attacker).\n   The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI.\n   This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the\n   redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to\n   the user-agent's authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session\n   cookie used to authenticate the user-agent).  The client SHOULD\n   utilize the \"state\" request parameter to deliver this value to the\n   authorization server when making an authorization request.\n   Once authorization has been obtained from the end-user, the\n   authorization server redirects the end-user's user-agent back to the\n   client with the required binding value contained in the \"state\"\n   parameter.  The binding value enables the client to verify the\n   validity of the request by matching the binding value to the\n   user-agent's authenticated state.  The binding value used for CSRF\n   protection MUST contain a non-guessable value (as described in\n   Credentials-Guessing Attacks), and the user-agent's authenticated state (e.g.,\n   session cookie, HTML5 local storage) MUST be kept in a location\n   accessible only to the client and the user-agent (i.e., protected by\n   same-origin policy).\n   A CSRF attack against the authorization server's authorization\n   endpoint can result in an attacker obtaining end-user authorization\n   for a malicious client without involving or alerting the end-user.\n   The authorization server MUST implement CSRF protection for its\n   authorization endpoint and ensure that a malicious client cannot\n   obtain authorization without the awareness and explicit consent of\n   the resource owner.\nMisuse of Access Token to Impersonate Resource Owner in Implicit Flow \n\n   For public clients using implicit flows, this specification does not\n   provide any method for the client to determine what client an access\n   token was issued to.\n   A resource owner may willingly delegate access to a resource by\n   granting an access token to an attacker's malicious client.  This may\n   be due to phishing or some other pretext.  An attacker may also steal\n   a token via some other mechanism.  An attacker may then attempt to\n   impersonate the resource owner by providing the access token to a\n   legitimate public client.\n   In the implicit flow (response_type=token), the attacker can easily\n   switch the token in the response from the authorization server,\n   replacing the real access token with the one previously issued to the\n   attacker.\n   Servers communicating with native applications that rely on being\n   passed an access token in the back channel to identify the user of\n   the client may be similarly compromised by an attacker creating a\n   compromised application that can inject arbitrary stolen access\n   tokens.\n   Any public client that makes the assumption that only the resource\n   owner can present it with a valid access token for the resource is\n   vulnerable to this type of attack.\n   This type of attack may expose information about the resource owner\n   at the legitimate client to the attacker (malicious client).  This\n   will also allow the attacker to perform operations at the legitimate\n   client with the same permissions as the resource owner who originally\n   granted the access token or authorization code.\n   Authenticating resource owners to clients is out of scope for this\n   specification.  Any specification that uses the authorization process\n   as a form of delegated end-user authentication to the client (e.g.,\n   third-party sign-in service) MUST NOT use the implicit flow without\n   additional security mechanisms that would enable the client to\n   determine if the access token was issued for its use (e.g., audience-\n   restricting the access token).\n"},"content/urlencoded.html":{"url":"content/urlencoded.html","title":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded Media Type","keywords":"","body":"\nbody {\n  counter-reset: h1 30;\n}\n\nUse of application/x-www-form-urlencoded Media Type\nExcerpted from Appendix B of OAuth 2.0 RFC at\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#appendix-B\n\n  At the time of publication of OAuth 2.0 specification, the\n   \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" media type was defined in\n   Section 17.13.4 of W3C.REC-html401-19991224 but not registered in\n   the IANA MIME Media Types registry\n   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types).
