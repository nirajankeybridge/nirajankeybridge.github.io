Operation Near the Canada-U.S. Border\n17.1 Background\nThe bands 54-60 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz, 470-608 MHz and 614-698 MHz are currently covered by theAgreement Between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America Related to the TV Broadcasting Service and the Associated Working Arrangement(the Agreement), theLetter of Understanding (LOU),Footnote5which covers areas within 400 km of the border, and theInterim Agreement Between Canada and the United States Concerning Digital Television (DTV)(the Interim Agreement).\nThese three agreements and working arrangements deal with the sharing and use of the bands by broadcasting services operating in the United States and in Canada. In addition, the LOU specifies that new (non-broadcasting) services shall not claim protection from DTV stations or analog TV stations in either country.\nThe LOU does not deal with non-broadcasting versus non-broadcasting operations in the border area. Therefore, until such time as a new Agreement can be reached between Canada and the United States, any authorization issued for non-broadcasting use in Canada within 400 km of the border area must be on a no-interference, no-protection basis with respect to broadcasting services in the United States.\n17.2 Protection Criteria for U.S. Stations\nOperating U.S. broadcasting stations, protected receive sites and LPA are to be protected according to the same criteria specified for Canadian stations above, with the exception that protected contours and/or operational areas will be assumed to stop at the Canada/U.S. border. The required separation distances extend within Canada.\n\n"},"is-my-transmission-protected-from-interference-while-im-using-tvws.html":{"url":"is-my-transmission-protected-from-interference-while-im-using-tvws.html","title":"Is my transmission protected from interference while I’m using TVWS?","keywords":"","body":"WSD are license exempt and thus, by definition, receive no protection.

A copy of the Service Standards is at http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf08802.html.\nAfter confirming that the source of interference is a particular WSD, the Department may issue to the operator of the device a notice pursuant to paragraph 5(1)(l) of the Radiocommunication Act to cease or modify operation of this device immediately.\nShould the operator of the interference-causing WSD fail to comply with this noticeand/oris found to benon-compliantwith technical requirements outlined in Radio Standards Specification RSS-222, ISED Canada will require the device owner to immediately cease operation of the device in question. In this case, the Department may also require the WSDBA, upon receipt of a written request from ISED Canada, to cease to provide available channels to the interference-causing device.\nISED Canada will require the WSDBA to take appropriate corrective action to resolve interference concerns linked to the following:\n\noperating problems or deficiencies of a designated WSDB; and/or\na designated WSDB’s failure to meet technical or operational requirements as set out in DBS-01\n\n\nTo aid with the investigation, log files are maintained regarding WSD registrations for at least 60 days.\nAdditionally, Industry Canada can also unauthorize use of certain channels by certain WSDs.\nSection 18 of the DBS-01 — White Space Database Specifications is as follows:\n\n18. Interference Response\nInterference response remains Industry Canada’s responsibility. In order to facilitate this, a WSDB shall:\n\nRetain logs of WSD queries and responses for sixty (60) days to allow for audits in the case of interference reports. This information shall be provided to Industry Canada following a formal request by the Department; and\nBe capable of indicating, upon request by Industry Canada, that no channels are available when queried by a specific WSD or mode of WSDs. This capability is to be implemented such that a mode of a WSD, or all WSDs, can also be denied to channels on the basis of a geographic area defined by a point and radius, or by a quadrilateral defined by straight lines connecting four geographic points.\n\n\nHowever, on-the-ground enforcement is out of scope for WSDBA.\n"},"i-did-not-find-answer-to-my-question-here-what-do-i-do-next.html":{"url":"i-did-not-find-answer-to-my-question-here-what-do-i-do-next.html","title":"I did not find answer to my question here.
