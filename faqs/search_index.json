Il est extrait ci-dessous pour votre commodité:\n\n17. Exploitation à proximité de la frontière entre le Canada et les États-Unis\n17.1 Contexte\nLes bandes de 54 à 60 MHz, de 76 à 88 MHz, de 174 à 216 MHz, de 470 à 608 MHz et de 614 à 698 MHz sont actuellement régies par l’Accord entre le gouvernement du Canada et le gouvernement des États Unis d’Amérique relatif au service de radiodiffusion télévisuelle et l’entente officieuse s’y rapportant, la Lettre d’entente (LE), qui couvre les zones à 400 km ou moins de la frontière, et l’Accord provisoire entre le Canada et les États Unis concernant la télévision numérique (TVN), (l’Accord provisoire).\nCes trois accords et arrangements administratifs portent sur le partage et l’utilisation des bandes par les services de radiodiffusion exploités aux États Unis et au Canada. En outre, la LE précise que les nouveaux services (autres que de radiodiffusion) ne doivent pas demander de protection de la part des stations de TVN ou de télévision analogique de l’un ou l’autre des pays.\nLa LE ne traite que de radiodiffusion entre les stations dans la région frontalière. Par conséquent, tant qu’il n’y aura pas de nouvel accord entre le Canada et les États-Unis, toute autorisation donnée à l’égard d’une utilisation autre que de radiodiffusion au Canada à 400 km ou moins de la frontière doit être accordée en régime de non-brouillage et de non- protection afférent aux services de radiodiffusion exploités aux États-Unis.\nLe titre complet de la LE est le suivant : Lettre d’entente entre la Federal Communications Commission des États-Unis d’Amérique et Industrie Canada concernant l’exploitation des bandes de fréquences 54-72 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz et 470-806 MHz par le service de radiodiffusion télévisuelle numérique le long de la frontière américano-canadienne.\n17.2 Critères de protection pour les stations américaines\nLes stations de radiodiffusion, les sites de récepteurs protégés et les DFP exploités aux États Unis doivent être protégés par les mêmes critères que les stations canadiennes susmentionnées, sauf que leurs contours de protection et/ou leurs zones d’exploitation seront considérés comme s’arrêtant à la frontière entre le Canada et les États-Unis. Les distances de séparation requises s’étendent à l’intérieur du Canada.\n\n"},"is-my-transmission-protected-from-interference-while-im-using-tvws.html":{"url":"is-my-transmission-protected-from-interference-while-im-using-tvws.html","title":"Ma transmission est-elle protégée des interférences pendant que j'utilise TVWS?","keywords":"","body":"WSD sont exempts de licence et donc, par définition, ne reçoivent aucune protection.

A list of ISED Canada’s offices is provided in Radiocommunication Information Circular RIC-66, available at http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01742.html.\nUne liste des bureaux de ISED Canada est fournie dans la Circulaire d’information sur les radiocommunications CIR-66, laquelle est accessible à l’adresse Internet suivante : http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/fra/sf01742.html.\nEn vertu de la Loi sur la radiocommunication, le brouillage préjudiciable est ainsi décrit : « brouillage préjudiciable, effet non désiré d’une énergie électromagnétique due aux émissions, rayonnements ou inductions qui compromet le fonctionnement d’un système de radiocommunication relié à la sécurité ou qui dégrade ou entrave sérieusement ou interrompt de façon répétée le fonctionnement d’appareils radio ou de matériel radiosensible. »\nLa procédure d’enquête en cas de brouillage préjudiciable aux systèmes de radiocommunication autorisés est décrite à la section 4 des normes de service de ISED Canada relativement à la gestion du spectre.\nUne copie des normes de service est disponible sur le site Internet suivant : http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/fra/sf08802.html.\nAprès avoir confirmé que le brouillage est causé par un DEB (WSD), le Ministère, conformément à l’alinéa 5(1)l) de la Loi sur la radiocommunication, peut émettre un avis enjoignant l’exploitant de cesser ou de modifier immédiatement l’exploitation de ce dispositif.\nSi l’exploitant du DEB (WSD) causant le brouillage ne respecte pas cet avis ou se révèle non conforme aux exigences techniques décrites dans le Cahier des charges sur les normes radioélectriques CNR-222, ISED Canada exigera du propriétaire du dispositif qu’il cesse immédiatement toute activité. Dans un tel cas, le Ministère peut aussi demander, par écrit, aux administrateurs, de cesser de fournir des canaux disponibles au DEB (WSD) à l’origine du brouillage.\nISED Canada demandera à l’administrateur de ladite BDEB (WSDBA) de prendre les mesures correctives appropriées pour résoudre le problème de brouillage à la suite de ce qui suit :\n\nS’il est établi que le brouillage est attribuable à des problèmes ou à des défaillances touchant une BDEB (WSDB) désignée;\nSi une BDEB (WSDB) désignée ne répond pas aux exigences techniques ou opérationnelles établies dans la spécification CBD-01.\n\nIl convient de noter que l’incapacité à se conformer aux demandes d’atténuation du brouillage envoyées par ISED Canada peut entraîner la révocation du statut d’un administrateur désigné. \n\nSection 18 du CBD-01 — Cahier des charges sur les bases de données d’espaces blancs est la suivante:\n\n18. Intervention en cas de brouillage\nL’intervention en cas de brouillage demeure la responsabilité d’Industrie Canada. Afin de faciliter la tâche d’Industrie Canada, les bases de données d’espaces blancs doivent :\n\nconserver un registre des requêtes des dispositifs d’espaces blancs et des réponses à ces requêtes pendant 60 jours pour permettre une vérification lorsque du brouillage est signalé. Ces renseignements doivent être mis à la disposition du personnel de ISED Canada à la suite d’une demande officielle du Ministère;\nà la demande de ISED Canada, pouvoir indiquer à un dispositif d’espaces blancs précis ou à un modèle précis de dispositifs qu’aucun canal n’est disponible. Cette capacité doit être mise en œuvre de façon à permettre le refus de l’accès à certains canaux à tous les dispositifs d’espaces blancs ou à un modèle de dispositifs précis dans un emplacement géographique défini par un point et un rayon ou par un quadrilatère constitué de lignes droites reliant quatre points géographiques.\n\n\nCependant, l'application sur le terrain est hors de portée pour WSDBA.\n"},"i-did-not-find-answer-to-my-question-here-what-do-i-do-next.html":{"url":"i-did-not-find-answer-to-my-question-here-what-do-i-do-next.html","title":"Je n'ai pas trouvé de réponse à ma question ici.
